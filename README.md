# Timestamp features rationale
- We compute rolling window features over 1h, 4h, and 24h intervals. 
   - Mean, min, max, and std capture the magnitude and variability of vitals. 
   - Slope gives the trend — whether the vital is rising or falling and how fast. 
   - AUC measures cumulative exposure, i.e., how much and for how long a patient has experienced abnormal values. 
- These features provide temporal context for the ML model, so it doesn’t just see isolated values but also their trajectory over time.

 # Model Comparison: LightGBM vs Neural Network (V1 & V2)

```text
| Aspect | LightGBM (V1) | Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) (V2) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **ML Model Name / Type** | LightGBM (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) | Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)(Neural network) |
| **V1 / V2** | V1: uses patient-level features, baseline interpretable patient summary (classic tabular ML) | V2: uses timestamp-level features, advanced sequence modeling (modern deep learning) |
| **Input Datasets** | `news2_features_patient.csv` (patient-level summaries) | `news2_features_timestamp.csv` (time series of vitals, missingness flags) |
| **Optional Inputs** | Timestamp features could be added later for hybrid model | Patient-level summary features from `news2_features_patient.csv` can be appended but not mandatory |
| **Reason for this input choice** | LightGBM is a tree-based model: handles static features and aggregates well; does not naturally model temporal sequences | Neural networks (LSTM/TCN) can model temporal trends, sequences, and interactions over time; need full timestamp features to exploit sequential information |
| **Why two different models** | 1. LightGBM: fast, interpretable (feature importance), strong baseline.<br>2. Neural network: captures temporal dynamics, can potentially improve predictive performance on time-series deterioration | Complements LightGBM; addresses potential limitations of static patient summaries by using sequential information in timestamp features |
| **Strengths** | - Handles missing values gracefully.<br>- Fast training and inference.<br>- Provides feature importances.<br>- Works well with tabular summary features. | - Models temporal trends and interactions.<br>- Can capture subtle patterns in sequences of vitals.<br>- Potentially better performance on real-time deterioration prediction. |
| **Weaknesses / Limitations** | - Ignores sequence and timing of events.<br>- May lose some granularity of patient trajectory.<br>- Cannot capture interactions over time. | - Requires more computation and tuning.<br>- Harder to interpret.<br>- Sensitive to missing data; requires careful imputation or masking. |
| **Output** | Predictions per patient, feature importances, evaluation metrics (AUROC, PR-AUC, etc.) | Predictions per timestamp or per patient trajectory, evaluation metrics (AUROC, PR-AUC, potentially time-dependent metrics) |
| **Use case / Deployment** | Baseline model; interpretable; fast deployment; can be used for early warning systems using summary features | Advanced model for final deployment or v2 experimentation; may be integrated in real-time monitoring dashboards for continuous deterioration prediction |
